### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised learning algorithm** that can be used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the proximity of data points to a given query point. In KNN, the output is based on the majority vote (for classification) or average (for regression) of the neighbors.

### Key Concept:
- **Distance Metric**: The algorithm calculates the distance between data points to determine which points are closest to the query point. Common distance metrics include Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski distance.
- **K**: The number of nearest neighbors to consider for making the prediction.

### Steps Involved in KNN Algorithm:

1. **Choose the number of neighbors (K)**: You first select how many neighbors (K) you want to consider for the prediction.
2. **Distance Measurement**: For a new data point (the query point), calculate the distance from this point to all the data points in the training dataset.
3. **Find the K-nearest neighbors**: Sort the distances and pick the K nearest data points.
4. **Make Predictions**:
   - **Classification**: For classification, the majority class among the K nearest neighbors is chosen.
   - **Regression**: For regression, the average of the K nearest neighbors is taken as the prediction.

### KNN Algorithm (Step-by-Step):

1. **Step 1: Choose K and a distance metric**.
   - Select the number of neighbors (K) you want to consider. Typically, you can start with a small value like 3 or 5.
   - Decide on the distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.).

2. **Step 2: Compute the distance from the query point to each data point**.
   - Use a distance formula (e.g., Euclidean distance) to compute how far the query point is from all other points in the dataset.

3. **Step 3: Sort the distances**.
   - Once you have the distances for all data points, sort them in ascending order.

4. **Step 4: Select the top K data points**.
   - Choose the K data points that are closest to the query point.

5. **Step 5: Make predictions**.
   - For classification: The predicted class is the one that appears most frequently among the K neighbors.
   - For regression: The predicted value is the mean (average) of the values of the K nearest neighbors.

### Syntax of KNN in Python (using Scikit-Learn)

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier  # For classification
# or
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor  # For regression

# Initializing the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, 
                             weights='uniform', 
                             algorithm='auto', 
                             metric='minkowski', 
                             p=2)

# Fit the model with training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the target for new data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Parameters in KNN:

1. **`n_neighbors` (int)**: 
   - Defines the number of neighbors to use for prediction.
   - **Default value**: 5
   - **Typical range**: 1 to a large number.
   - **Effect**: If K is too small, the model may be too sensitive to noise. If K is too large, the model may be overly simplistic.

2. **`weights` (string or callable)**:
   - Determines how much influence each neighbor has.
   - **Options**:
     - **'uniform'**: All neighbors are weighted equally.
     - **'distance'**: Neighbors closer to the query point have more influence.
     - **Callable**: A function that takes the distance of each neighbor and returns a weight.
   - **Default**: 'uniform'

3. **`algorithm` (string)**:
   - Specifies the algorithm to use for finding nearest neighbors.
   - **Options**:
     - **'auto'**: The algorithm is automatically selected based on the data.

   - Power parameter for the Minkowski distance. If `p=1`, it’s equivalent to using Manhattan distance, and if `p=2`, it’s equivalent to using Euclidean distance.
   - **Default**: 2

6. **`leaf_size` (int)**:
   - This is used only when using Ball Tree or KD Tree algorithms. It controls the speed of the construction and query of the tree.
   - **Default**: 30

7. **`n_jobs` (int)**:
   - Number of CPU cores to use for parallelization. Use -1 to use all available cores.
   - **Default**: None (uses a single core).

### When to Use KNN:

- **Simple classification/regression problems**: KNN works well for small to medium-sized datasets where the relationship between features is not highly complex.
- **Non-linear decision boundaries**: KNN can be effective when the data has complex relationships between features.
- **When model interpretability is not a priority**: KNN is a memory-based algorithm, meaning it stores the entire training dataset, making it less interpretable compared to other models.
- **When computational efficiency is not critical**: KNN can become computationally expensive as the dataset grows because it needs to calculate distances to all training points for each prediction.

### When to Avoid KNN:
- **Large datasets**: KNN can be slow with large datasets because of the distance calculation for each prediction.
- **High-dimensional data**: It suffers from the **curse of dimensionality**, meaning its performance degrades as the number of features increases.
- **Imbalanced classes**: If one class is much more frequent than others, KNN might be biased towards that class.

### Example Use Case:
KNN is often used in applications like:
- **Recommendation systems**: For finding products or content similar to what a user has liked.
- **Image recognition**: In computer vision tasks to classify images based on their nearest neighbors.
- **Medical diagnoses**: Predicting a disease based on similar cases in the medical records.

### Conclusion:
KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm, but it has its limitations. It is particularly useful in situations where the relationship between features is not linear, and when the dataset is relatively small to medium-sized. However, it may not scale well with large datasets or high-dimensional data.

In the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the **distance metric** is crucial for determining how to measure the proximity between data points. The choice of the distance metric depends on the nature of your data and the problem at hand. Here are the most commonly used metrics, along with their explanations and when to use them:

### 1. **Euclidean Distance**
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
     \]
     where \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \) and \( \mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n) \) are two points in \(n\)-dimensional space.
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - **Continuous data** with numerical values where the concept of "distance" makes sense.
     - **Spatial data** (e.g., coordinates, geographic data) where you need to find the "straight-line" distance.
     - When the scale of features is similar or already normalized (e.g., each feature has the same unit or range).
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Simple to compute and widely used.
     - Suitable for data that is well-scaled and represents "real" distances (e.g., geographical locations, height, weight).
   
   - **Cons**:
     - Sensitive to scale: If features are not normalized, features with larger ranges will dominate the distance calculation.

### 2. **Manhattan Distance (City Block Distance)**
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|
     \]
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - When data is composed of **categorical or discrete values**.
     - When you are dealing with data that represents grid-like structures (like a city map, where travel is along grid lines).
     - **Sparse data** or **data with outliers**: Manhattan distance is less sensitive to large differences between individual coordinates than Euclidean distance.
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Works well when the data has grid-like structure or when "moving" in straight lines on a grid.
     - Robust to outliers as it doesn’t square the differences, thus large differences are not magnified.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - Not as intuitive for measuring similarity in most problems that don't involve grid-like data.

### 3. **Minkowski Distance**
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p \right)^{1/p}
     \]
     where \( p \) is a parameter. When \( p = 1 \), it becomes Manhattan distance, and when \( p = 2 \), it becomes Euclidean distance.
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - **General use case**: It is a generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, so you can experiment with \( p \) values to suit your data.
     - Useful when you want to **experiment** with different values of \( p \) to see how it affects the distance calculation and model performance.
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Provides flexibility to tune the parameter \( p \), allowing you to fine-tune the distance metric based on your data.
     - Suitable for a wide range of data types (numerical, continuous, etc.).
   
   - **Cons**:
     - Choosing the right value of \( p \) may require experimentation and cross-validation.

### 4. **Cosine Similarity**
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{cosine\_similarity}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}}{||\mathbf{x}|| \cdot ||\mathbf{y}||}
     \]
     where \( \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} \) is the dot product of vectors, and \( ||\mathbf{x}|| \) is the magnitude (norm) of vector \( \mathbf{x} \).
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - **Text analysis** or **document similarity**: When working with text data (e.g., document classification, information retrieval), where you want to measure the angle between two vectors rather than their distance in a traditional sense.
     - **Sparse data**: Cosine similarity works well with sparse data, such as word embeddings in NLP tasks.
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Focuses on the direction (angle) between vectors, which is useful when the **magnitude** of the vectors is not important (e.g., frequency of terms in text).
     - It normalizes the data so that it handles data with varying scales naturally.
   
   - **Cons**:
     - Doesn't consider the magnitude or absolute differences between features, which can sometimes be a drawback if magnitude is important (e.g., in regression problems).

### 5. **Hamming Distance**
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{1}(x_i \neq y_i)
     \]
     where \( \mathbb{1}(x_i \neq y_i) \) is 1 if the \(i\)-th feature of \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{y} \) are different, and 0 if they are the same.
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - **Categorical data** (e.g., binary or nominal data), where the features represent distinct categories (e.g., gender, type of vehicle).
     - When you need to measure the similarity between two strings or sequences, particularly in **binary classification** tasks (like error detection or DNA sequence comparison).
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Very simple and intuitive for categorical and binary data.
     - Efficient for tasks involving strings or categorical values.

   - **Cons**:
     - Not suitable for continuous data or for data with varying scales.
     - Doesn't account for "closeness" between categories (e.g., distance between "red" and "blue" would be the same as between "red" and "green" even if some categories are closer in meaning).

### 6. **Chebyshev Distance**
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \max_i |x_i - y_i|
     \]
   
   - **When to Use**:
     - When you want to measure the maximum difference along any dimension.
     - Suitable for problems where the largest difference is the most important (e.g., finding the most outlying data point in a multi-dimensional space).
   
   - **Pros**:
     - Simple to compute.
     - Useful in certain applications where only the largest difference matters.

   - **Cons**:
     - Not intuitive for most real-world problems. Can be overly simplistic in many cases.

---

### Summary of When to Use Different Metrics:
1. **Euclidean**: Use for continuous, numerical data, especially when you have no significant outliers, and data is normalized.
2. **Manhattan**: Use when you have grid-like structures, or data is sparse or contains outliers.
3. **Minkowski**: Use when you need flexibility in choosing the distance parameter (e.g., you might want to experiment with different values of \( p \)).
4. **Cosine Similarity**: Ideal for text or high-dimensional sparse data, where the magnitude of features doesn't matter, only the relative orientation.
5. **Hamming**: Use for binary or categorical data, especially when dealing with strings or sequences.
6. **Chebyshev**: Use when you are interested in the largest single dimension's difference, rather than the cumulative distance.

Selecting the right metric is essential for the KNN algorithm to perform well, and it should be chosen based on the nature of the data and the specific problem you are solving.

Evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the performance of machine learning models, particularly in classification and regression tasks. The choice of metric depends on the nature of the problem, the type of model, and the goals of the analysis. Here's a detailed look at different evaluation metrics and when to use them:

---

### **1. Classification Metrics**
For classification tasks, the evaluation metrics help determine how well a model categorizes data into discrete classes.

#### **Accuracy**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}}
  \]
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **accuracy** when the classes are balanced (i.e., there is no significant class imbalance).
  - It's a general-purpose metric, but may not be ideal when dealing with imbalanced data.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to understand and compute.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Not informative** in the case of imbalanced datasets because it may give high scores even if the model predicts the majority class correctly.

---

#### **Precision**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
  \]
- **When to Use**:
  - Precision is important when the **cost of false positives** is high (e.g., email spam detection or medical diagnoses where false positives can be costly).
  
- **Pros**:
  - Useful in problems where **false positives** are costly or undesirable.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Does not consider **false negatives**, so it might not be ideal when both false positives and false negatives need to be minimized.

---

#### **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
  \]
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **recall** when the **cost of false negatives** is high (e.g., in medical testing where failing to identify a disease could be fatal).
  
- **Pros**:
  - Focuses on capturing as many positives as possible, useful in high-risk situations.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Doesn't account for **false positives**, so it may lead to a model that identifies a lot of positive cases but with many false positives.

---

#### **F1 Score**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  \]
- **When to Use**:
  - Use when you want to balance both **precision** and **recall**, especially when there is a class imbalance.
  - F1 score is often used when you care equally about precision and recall, and you want a single metric to evaluate the model.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Provides a balance between **precision** and **recall**, useful in imbalanced datasets.
  
- **Cons**:
  - May be difficult to interpret compared to accuracy since it's a trade-off metric.

---

#### **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve)**
- **Formula**:
  - The **ROC curve** plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity). The **AUC** measures the area under this curve.
  
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **ROC-AUC** when you have binary classification tasks and want to evaluate the model across all possible thresholds.
  - Ideal for **imbalanced datasets** because it gives a better understanding of model performance across thresholds.
  
- **Pros**:
  - ROC-AUC considers all possible thresholds and provides a broader view of the model's performance.
  
- **Cons**:
  - The interpretation of **AUC** may not be straightforward, and it can be influenced by the class distribution.

---

#### **Confusion Matrix**
- **When to Use**:
  - A **confusion matrix** is useful for providing a complete view of the model's performance by showing the count of **true positives**, **false positives**, **true negatives**, and **false negatives**.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Provides a more granular view of where the model is making errors.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Needs to be supplemented with other metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) to get a full understanding of performance.

---

### **2. Regression Metrics**
For regression tasks, you need metrics to evaluate the model's ability to predict continuous values.

#### **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
  \]
  where \( y_i \) is the true value, and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.
  
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **MAE** when you want a simple interpretation of the error in terms of the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to understand and compute.
  - **Robust to outliers**, as it doesn’t square the error.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Does not give emphasis to larger errors, which might be important in some contexts.

---

#### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]
  
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **MSE** when you want to give more **weight to larger errors** (since it squares the error).
  - MSE is commonly used for **model optimization** since it is differentiable, making it easier for gradient-based methods.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Penalizes larger errors more than MAE, encouraging the model to minimize large mistakes.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Sensitive to **outliers** because the error is squared, so large deviations can dominate the result.

---

#### **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
  \]
  
- **When to Use**:
  - Use **RMSE** when you want to express the error in the same units as the original data (since squaring the errors in MSE can distort the interpretation).
  - RMSE is particularly useful when large errors are very undesirable.
  
- **Pros**:
  - It’s interpretable in the same scale as the target variable (unlike MSE).
  
- **Cons**:
  - Still sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of the error.

---

#### **R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
  \]
  where \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the true values.

- **When to Use**:
  - Use **R-squared** to understand how well your model **explains the variance** of the target variable.
  - It's a good metric to evaluate model performance in linear regression problems.
  
- **Pros**:
  - Provides a clear understanding of the **explanatory power** of the model.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Does not account for overfitting**—a model can have high \( R^2 \) even if it's overfitted.
  - Can be misleading if the model doesn't fit the data well.

---

### **3. Other Metrics**
- **Log-Loss (for Classification)**:
  - **Log-loss** measures the **performance of classification models** where the output is probability-based (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks).
  - Lower log-loss indicates better model performance.
  
- **AUC-PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve)**:
  - When working with **highly imbalanced datasets**, AUC-PR is often preferred over ROC-AUC because it focuses on the performance with respect to the positive class.

---

### **Conclusion**
- For **classification problems**:
  - Use **accuracy** when the classes are balanced.
  - Use **precision, recall, or F1 score** when there is class imbalance.
  - Use **AUC-ROC** for models that need to be evaluated across different thresholds.
- For **regression problems**:
  - Use **MAE or RMSE** for error evaluation, with RMSE being preferable when large errors matter.
  - Use **R-squared** for explaining the model’s goodness-of-fit.

The choice of evaluation metric depends heavily on the problem and the specific objectives of the model, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes or high-dimensional data.

### **Identifying Overfitting and Underfitting in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
In **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, overfitting and underfitting are related to the choice of the **number of neighbors (k)** and the nature of the data. Let's go through how to identify and handle overfitting and underfitting in KNN.

---

### **1. Identifying Overfitting in KNN**

**Overfitting** occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to learn noise or minor fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns. In KNN, this usually happens when the number of neighbors `k` is too small.

#### **Signs of Overfitting:**

- **High accuracy on training data, low accuracy on test data**: 
  - If the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it's likely overfitting.
  - For example, if your KNN model has 95% accuracy on training data but only 60% on test data, the model has memorized the training data but can't generalize to unseen data.
  
- **Low `k` value (e.g., `k=1`)**: 
  - A low value of `k` means that the model looks at only one neighbor to classify data, which can cause it to overfit to individual data points. 
  - With `k=1`, the model can perfectly fit the training data but is very sensitive to noise and variations in the test data.

---

### **2. Identifying Underfitting in KNN**

**Underfitting** occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. In KNN, this typically happens when the number of neighbors `k` is too large.

#### **Signs of Underfitting:**

- **Low accuracy on both training and test data**: 
  - If the model performs poorly on both the training and test datasets, it's a sign of underfitting.
  - For example, if both the training accuracy and test accuracy are consistently low, the model is not able to capture the underlying structure of the data.

- **High `k` value (e.g., `k=100` on a small dataset)**: 
  - A very large value of `k` means that the model looks at a broader neighborhood, which can smooth out important details in the data and result in underfitting. 
  - A large `k` makes the decision boundary too simple and may ignore important patterns.

---

### **3. How to Handle Overfitting in KNN**

**Overfitting** can be mitigated by reducing the model's complexity. In KNN, overfitting is usually a result of having a small value of `k` (e.g., `k=1`). By increasing `k`, we smooth the decision boundary, reducing sensitivity to noise.

#### **Ways to Handle Overfitting:**

1. **Increase the value of `k`:**
   - **Increasing `k`** helps in averaging the nearest neighbors and reduces the impact of noise. A larger `k` will reduce the model's sensitivity to specific data points and generalize better.
   - Typically, values of `k` between 3 and 15 work well for most problems, though this depends on the dataset and should be tuned using cross-validation.
   
2. **Use Cross-Validation**:
   - **Cross-validation** (e.g., K-fold cross-validation) helps to choose the optimal value of `k`. It provides a more reliable measure of model performance by testing the model on different subsets of data.
   - You can check the accuracy for different values of `k` to find the one that balances training and test performance.

3. **Use Feature Scaling (Normalization/Standardization)**:
   - KNN is sensitive to the scale of the features because it uses distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) to find nearest neighbors.
   - **Feature scaling** (such as **standardization** or **min-max normalization**) ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation and helps improve the model's performance and generalization.

---

### **4. How to Handle Underfitting in KNN**

**Underfitting** can be handled by reducing the simplicity of the model. In KNN, underfitting typically occurs when the value of `k` is too large, resulting in overly smooth decision boundaries.

#### **Ways to Handle Underfitting:**

1. **Decrease the value of `k`:**
   - **Decreasing `k`** allows the model to be more sensitive to the local structure of the data, capturing more patterns and complexity. However, be careful not to make `k` too small, as it could lead to overfitting.
   - Start by testing small values of `k` (e.g., `k=1` or `k=3`), but monitor the performance to avoid overfitting.

2. **Use more relevant features**:
   - If the model is underfitting, it could be that the feature set does not contain enough information to make accurate predictions.
   - **Feature engineering** (creating new features, removing irrelevant ones) can help the model capture more complex relationships.
   - **Dimensionality reduction** (e.g., PCA) can be used if there are too many irrelevant features.

3. **Use better distance metrics**:
   - If the dataset has a complex structure, **Euclidean distance** may not always be the best choice.
   - Try different distance metrics like **Manhattan distance**, **Cosine similarity**, or **Minkowski distance** depending on the nature of the data.

---

### **5. Example of Identifying Overfitting and Underfitting in KNN (Python)**

Here’s a Python example using **Scikit-learn** to identify and handle overfitting and underfitting in KNN:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load Iris dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Scale the data (important for KNN)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Try different values of k and check the performance
k_values = range(1, 21)
train_accuracies = []
test_accuracies = []

for k in k_values:
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
    test_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Accuracy on training and test set
    train_accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_train, train_pred))
    test_accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test, test_pred))

# Plot accuracies for different values of k
plt.plot(k_values, train_accuracies, label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(k_values, test_accuracies, label='Test Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Number of Neighbors (k)')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Overfitting and Underfitting in KNN')
plt.show()

# Find the optimal k (the one with highest test accuracy)
optimal_k = k_values[np.argmax(test_accuracies)]
print(f"Optimal k value: {optimal_k}")

#### **Explanation of the Code**:
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- **Feature Scaling**: The features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure each feature has the same scale (important for KNN).
- **Model Training**: A KNN model is trained for a range of `k` values, and both training and test accuracies are computed.
- **Plotting**: We plot the accuracy for both training and test data as a function of `k` to visualize overfitting (high training accuracy, low test accuracy) and underfitting (low accuracy on both).
- **Optimal `k`**: We can observe the point where the test accuracy is highest, which is typically the optimal `k`.

### **Summary of Identifying and Handling Overfitting and Underfitting in KNN**:

- **Overfitting**:
  - Identified by **high accuracy on training data, low accuracy on test data**.
  - Caused by a **small value of `k`**.
  - Handled by increasing `k`, using cross-validation, and scaling features.

- **Underfitting**:
  - Identified by **low accuracy on both training and test data**.
  - Caused by a **large value of `k`**.
  - Handled by decreasing `k`, using more relevant features, and experimenting with different distance metrics.

By carefully adjusting the `k` parameter and utilizing techniques like cross-validation, KNN can provide optimal performance while avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.
